### 📝 X) Read and Summarize Task

<a name="ghidra-for-reverse-engineering"></a>
#### 🔍 Ghidra for Reverse Engineering

Videolog about completing a challenge in PicoCTF 2022 called bbbloat

task is to reverse engineer a linux binary, start with installing some useful apps like ltrace.

running ltrace and strace, then objdump looking for the "password" string. no success.

used file command to see that its a stripped binary.(stripped binaries does not contain debugging info)

Going into installing ghidra and then running it, analyzing the binary

Window -> Defined data. looking for the favourite number entry

Renaming functions in the decompile window

he finds a function where it checks if answer is equal to a hex number, converts it to decimal and it works, flag captured.

<a name="optional-the-ghidra-book"></a>
#### 📚 Optional: The Ghidra Book

unable to access material currently, skipped this optional task

<a name="a-install-ghidra"></a>
## 🛠️ A) Install Ghidra

Previously installed ghidra11 during class. also needs java sdk.

'sudo apt-get install openjdk-17-jdk'


<a name="b-reverse-engineer-packd"></a>
## 📜 B) Reverse Engineer packd to C with Ghidra

Opening packd in ghidra

![alt text](h4images/image.png)

Open the file and yes to analyze. This file was not yet unpacked as per previous task, not sure if its allowed but i went ahead and `upx -d` to make some more sense into the decompilation results.

![alt text](h4images/image-2.png)

After unpacking the main function is found instantly in the symbol tree.

![alt text](h4images/image-3.png)

main function:

![alt text](h4images/image-1.png)

Renaming some functions and added explanations:

```diff
undefined8 main(void)

{
// this is the main function
undefined8 main(void)

{
// int difference compares the result of input to  the password
  int difference;
// this is the input
  char input [32];

// prints question  
  puts("What\'s the password?");
// scans for input
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_0010201d,input);
// compares input and password difference
  difference = strcmp(input,"piilos-AnAnAs");
// if input&pw difference = 0, print flag, else no bonus.
  if (difference == 0) {
    puts("Yes! That\'s the password. FLAG{Tero-0e3bed0a89d8851da933c64fefad4ff2}");
  }
  else {
    puts("Sorry, no bonus.");
  }
// exit program
  return 0;
}
```

my C is not strong enough to make it compileable from here, but with chatGPT it was easily [done](h4images/image-5.png)

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    int difference;
    char input[32];
    
    puts("What's the password?");
    scanf("%31s", input); // Use "%31s" to avoid buffer overflow
    difference = strcmp(input, "piilos-AnAnAs");
    if (difference == 0) {
        puts("Yes! That's the password. FLAG{Tero-0e3bed0a89d8851da933c64fefad4ff2}");
    } else {
        puts("Sorry, no bonus.");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
inserted code to file pakki.c then:
`gcc -o main pakki.c` 
successfully compiled and tested running and working:

<a name="c-modify-passtr-binary"></a>
## 🔧 C) Modify passtr Binary to accept all but the right password

Starting with opening file in ghidra, choose analyze yes.

from symbol tree, i open the main function

![alt text](h4images/image-6.png)

from here we want to edit the if function that checks if iVar == 0, to != 0, we can press the if function to show us the location in assembly and edit it there.

![alt text](h4images/image-7.png)

jnz is the part we want to edit to jz, rightclicking it and choosing patch instruction:
![alt text](h4images/image-8.png)

edited assembly:
![alt text](h4images/image-9.png)

then going to file -> export program

![alt text](h4images/image-11.png)

export as original file

now we can give it permissions and test if it works:

![alt text](h4images/image-10.png)

works as intended, "wrong" passwords pass, and the old "correct" password is now wrong.

starting with strings:

![alt text](h4images/image-23.png)

cant be password1? have to try it anyway

![alt text](h4images/image-24.png)

checking strace and ltrace, cant see a solution there.

going into ghidra for reversing code

![alt text](h4images/image-26.png)

named variables, spents lots of time trying to figure it out without help. 
"giving up" and asking chatgpt for guidance and solutions:

my partly renamed code with **commentary from gpt4o** for me to understand it better
```
#include <stdio.h>

undefined8 main(int param_1, long param_2)
{
    char passwordCharacter; // Holds the current character of the password being checked.
    undefined8 uVar1; // Return value of the function.
    long characterCount; // Counter for the position in the input and password.
    char inputCharacter; // Holds the current character of the user input being checked.

    // Check if exactly one argument is passed to the program.
    if (param_1 == 2) {
        passwordCharacter = 'p'; // Initialize the first expected password character ('p').
        characterCount = 0; // Initialize the counter for iterating through the input and password.

        do {
            // Retrieve the current character from the user's input based on characterCount.
            inputCharacter = *(char *)(*(long *)(param_2 + 8) + characterCount);

            // If the end of the input string is reached, break out of the loop.
            if (inputCharacter == '\0') break;

            // Compare the user input character to the value of the expected password character minus 1.
            // The user must supply a character whose decimal value is exactly one less
            // than the expected password character's value.
            if ((int)inputCharacter != passwordCharacter - 1) {
                // If the input does not match the expected obfuscated password character,
                // print a failure message and exit with an error code.
                printf("No, %s is not correct.\n", (char *)(*(long *)(param_2 + 8)));
                return 1;
            }

            // Move to the next password character in the "password1" string.
            passwordCharacter = "password1"[characterCount + 1];

            // Increment the counter to process the next character.
            characterCount = characterCount + 1;

        } while (passwordCharacter != '\0'); // Continue until the end of the password string is reached.

        // If all characters match, print a success message and return success code.
        printf("Yes, %s is correct!\n", (char *)(*(long *)(param_2 + 8)));
        uVar1 = 0; // Return success.
    } else {
        // If the incorrect number of arguments is provided, print a usage message and return an error code.
        puts("Need exactly one argument.");
        uVar1 = 0xffffffff; // Return error code.
    }

    return uVar1; // Return the final status code.
}

```

To crack the binary it seems i have to transform 'password1' to its ascii decimal number, then subtract 1 from the value, and transform back.

string: password1
decimal: 112 97 115 115 119 111 114 100 49

subtracted 1 from decimal character codes:
111 98 114 114 118 110 113 99 48

During previous tasks, tried different combinations and found empty to work

## 🌟 J) Optional: Solve Nora crackme02e

Doing some renaming similiarly to previous guide:

![alt text](h4images/image-30.png)

notice start with y, but pass dont have y

Did not have time to investigate further, noticed empty password works here also. bypassing the do while loop

## 📋 Assignments

a) Familiarize yourself with the vocabulary of the course, which is defined in the SFS-EN ISO/IEC 27000:2020 standard, chapter 3. Terms and Definitions. Find out the adjectives in the following paragraphs and explain in your own words what they mean: 3.2, 3.31, 3.56, 3.58, 3.77. (Technical tests on a computer are not required)

b) Familiarize yourself with the standard ISO 27034-1 - 5. Find out what the whole standard is about. (Technical tests on a computer are not required)

c) Listen to the podcast: Meurman 2021: Laatulöpinät 30: Information security in software development. What do you think of the podcast's claim? (Technical tests on a computer are not required)

d) Install Debian 12-Bookworm on the virtual machine. Update all programs. (Exceptionally, this subsection does not need to be reported, unless something is not working. The environment is needed for the next lesson. So the answer to this section is to acknowledge that Linux is installed.)

## (A) 📚 Course vocabulary from ISO 27000

### ⚔️ 3.2  Attack

"attempt to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorized access "

- In a cybersecurity setting Attack refers to any attempt to compromise or disrupt a system.
- **Example Attacks:** phishing, dossing, brute force, mitm. etc.


### 🚨 3.31 Information security incident

- An information security incident, is an event that happened or is happening that is compromising a system or information security.

- **Example event:** Firewall logs showing unusual and failed login attempts from a foreign country that typically has no access to company system.
 
### ✅ 3.56 Requirement

- Requirement is usually a rule that is obligatory

- **Exmple rule:** All employees are required to have MFA enabled to access company internal system.


### 🔍 3.58 Review

- A review is an activity taken to measure if something is appropriate sufficient or effective.

- **Example review:** Is the coffee break in the penthouse effective?

### 🔓 3.77 Vulnerability

- Weakness in an asset or control, that can be exploited

- **Example vulnerabilities:** Outdated operating systems, servers in a location without physical security (unlocked doors), easy or short passwords..

## (B) 📖 Standard ISO 27034-1 - 5

ISO 27034 is the Application Security ISO standard, containing a collection of six different parts:

- ISO/IEC 27034-1 Overview and Concepts
- ISO/IEC 27034-2 Organization Normative Framework (ONF)
- ISO/IEC 27034-3 Application Security Management Process (ASMP)
- ISO/IEC 27034-4 Application Security Validation (ASV)
- ISO/IEC 27034-5 Protocols and Data Structures for Application Security (ASMP and ASV Interoperability)
- ISO/IEC 27034-6 Security guidance for specific applications

**First part** (27034-1) is an overview of application security, it contains definitions, concepts, principles and processes. 

***Parts -2 -3 and -4*** are usually acquired together by organizations who want to implement the 27034 application security standard.

**Part 2**(27034-2) provides a framework for defining policies, processes and standards. 

**Part 3**(27034-3) Describes processes for managing app security continuously.

**Part 4**(27034-4) Outlines methods on how to meet the security requirements, 
comparing the "Actual Level of Trust" vs the "Targeted Level of Trust".

**Part 5**(27034-5) Defines protocols and XML Schema to help structure, validate, and automate the management and distribution of Application Security Controls (ASCs) across systems. Its useful for organizations intrested in distributing controls.

**Part 6**(27034-6) Provides guidance and examples of Application Security Controls (ASCs) customized to meet specific security requirements for various types of applications.

## (C) 🎙️ Toughts about the podcast 

My thoughts on the talking points and claims of the podcast (https://www.arter.fi/podcast/laatulopinat-podcast-tietoturvallissä-sämätärkäketyssa-tarkastele-kokonaisäätä-ja-hyodynna-viitekrämmet/):

### 1. 🔐 No software is completely secure.

- The statement is true in theory, but a Hello world program that runs offline on a computer would be 99,999% safe, but the more complex a program or service you want to run on a public network, the bigger the data security and its importance and challenge grows.

### 2. 🛡️ Administrative information security is a prerequisite for the success of technical information security.

- Somewhat agree, the bigger the scale in terms of software/services, the more important administrative information security is.


### 3. 🤖 Automation testing is very important in terms of software security.

- In my opinion, automation testing is a very effective way, especially in mobile programming when you want to test functionality on hundreds or thousands of different devices, but manual testing should not be completely excluded.


### 4. 💡 When designing software, a lot can be done to help the user to operate securely. However, these measures often have a negative impact on usability.

- Many see e.g. 2fa login as negative, or the need to log in to the work environment with vpn connection. But in my opinion absolutely important and efficient.


### 5. 📊 The information security design of the software is greatly influenced by how sensitive the data is to be handled by the software.

- The security design of a software should definately be influenced by the data. Example: to compare a healthcare app containing patient data vs a blog about cookie recipes.


### 6. 👀 Software developers always see their own software as significantly more risky than software made by others.

- I agree with this view and prefer integrating a trusted third-party login system, such as OAuth2, which brings a proven security framework, over building a custom login system from scratch.

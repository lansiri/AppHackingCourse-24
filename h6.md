## 🔍 A) Analyze File h1.jpg with previous level tools

File command to see some general file information

`file h1.jpg`

![alt text](h6images/image-3.png)
 
 Does not seem to reveal much, i doubt its just a jpg

also ghidra does not seem to show anything special, tried with a couple different "Language" settings

![alt text](h6images/image-4.png)

image data extraction tool exiftool output:

![alt text](h6images/image-5.png)

does not seem to indicate anything unusual.

next up strings:

`strings h1.jpg`

this is printing lots of data, repeating command with | less

![alt text](h6images/image-6.png)

found some hints that the file would contain more files packed


`strings h1.jpg | egrep "word|doc"`

![alt text](h6images/image-8.png)

<a name="b-analyze-file-h1jpg-with-binwalk"></a>
## 🛠️ B) Analyze File h1.jpg with next level tools: Binwalk

Found some hidden files inside image, to extract files:

`binwalk -e h1.jpg` 

![alt text](h6images/image-9.png)

seems to be contents of a word file?

![alt text](h6images/image-10.png)

examining some of the files:

### Examining files

`file 494F5.zip` reveals this "zip" file could be a word document?

renaming the file to 49.docx reveals document with some future predictions

![alt text](h6images/image-2.png)

![alt text](h6images/image-11.png)

the xml files contain data/metadata of the doc file

![alt text](h6images/image-16.png)

Rest of the files dont seem to have much revealing without digging deeper, decide to google some techiques to extract data with binwalk, found command to extract "all":

`binwalk --dd='.*' h1.jpg`

![alt text](h6images/image-12.png)

Looking at the output files in the explorer view, they contain image data also:

![alt text](h6images/image-13.png)

copied 4DE7B to jpg file

![alt text](h6images/image-14.png)

Opens normally, strings dont show anything special to me, also exiftool is pretty usual? 

4DE87 gives me error when trying to open it as image

![alt text](h6images/image-15.png)

Trying to extract the other files also unpacked the xml files with the zip "docx" file with the predictions

## 📱 C) FOSS (Free Android Open Source)

Tool/App chosen: Flashy
https://github.com/Crazy-Marvin/Flashy

downloaded newest version(13) from:
https://f-droid.org/en/packages/rocks.poopjournal.flashy/


<a name="c1-zip"></a>
### 📂 C1) ZIP

`unzip rocks.poopjournal.flashy_13.apk`

![alt text](h6images/image-18.png)

Files shown in explorer:

![alt text](h6images/image-20.png)

AndroidManifest.xml contains metadata about the app, package name, permissions etc.

DebugProbesKt.bin is related to kotlin debugging

resources.arsc file reveals a long list of all resources with `strings resources.arsc`

![alt text](h6images/image-21.png)

Folders mostly contain data and info that was compiled when app was made, 

- assets folder has raw files that are bundled into th APK, 

- kotlin folder has kotlin specific metadata and classes (app seems to be coded in kotlin)

- Meta-INF contains metadata and the manifest.mf file containing hashes for verifying the app

- res folder containing resources, images etc:

![alt text](h6images/image-19.png)

moving on to JADX for further examination

<a name="c2-jadx"></a>
### 📂 C2) JADX

downloaded latest version(1.5.1) from
https://github.com/skylot/jadx/releases/tag/v1.5.1

`jadx-cli´

opening the apk file in jadx reveals a tree of code and files

![alt text](h6images/image-22.png)

The main java file is found here:
![alt text](h6images/image-23.png)

And is the same content as on github:
https://github.com/Crazy-Marvin/Flashy/blob/development/app/src/main/java/rocks/poopjournal/flashy/activities/MainActivity.java

Opening the APK and extracting the code is pretty straightforward, i have previously used apktool but this seems to be easier with search and naviation functions.

<a name="c3-bytecode-viewer"></a>
### 📂 C3) Bytecode-viewer

setting up:
![alt text](h6images/image-24.png)

Opening the viewer and giving it our apk file reveals similiar view as JADX

![alt text](h6images/image-25.png)

Opening some random class reveals two different views, decompiler and dissassembler:

![alt text](h6images/image-26.png)

The Decoded Resources folder seems valuable, since it contains some previously encoded files decoded. like the AndroidManifest.xml

![alt text](h6images/image-27.png)

Most of the code is cut into smali files

![alt text](h6images/image-28.png)
mainactivity.smali

the viewer also has ability to show the image files:

![alt text](h6images/image-29.png)

## 💡 D) Optional: ESP32 Projects

Having used many of these before, choosing one I use daily for home automation, Tasmota

![alt text](h6images/image-30.png)

Similiar to other esp32 binaries, `file` misidentiefies as DOS executable


`strings tasmota.bin` reveals lots of content in plain text:

![alt text](h6images/image-31.png)

`xxd tasmota.bin`

![alt text](h6images/image-32.png)

has lots of data, but hard to digest

`binwalk -e tasmota.bin`

Extracts us some files:

![alt text](h6images/image-33.png)

`strings 27423 | less`

![alt text](h6images/image-34.png)

this is slightly easier to read, but still has lots of useless data, this could be used also to look for certain things like ip addresses or passwords with grep

![alt text](h6images/image-35.png)

`strings 3Ef17 | less` 

has slightly less data, lots of it is readable

![alt text](h6images/image-36.png)

`strings 3EF17 | less` 

![alt text](h6images/image-37.png)

contains lots of readable information.

Ghidra
Choosing file and Xtensa language does some decompiling, still not close to the source on github, missing function names also.

![alt text](h6images/image-38.png)

Tried binary ninja also:

![alt text](h6images/image-40.png)

This was just a rough look at the binary, more intresting would be following the network traffic of IoT devices.

Just to try it out, also binwalked the meshtastic firmware, completely different results:

### üìù X) Read and Summarize Task

<a name="owasp-top-10-a1---broken-access-control"></a>
#### üîó OWASP Top 10 A01 - Broken Access Control

OWASP A1 Broken access control is considered as the most serious web app risk since 2021 on the OWASP top10 list. 

In short, broken access control means there are vulnerabilities/bugs/misconfigurations with authentication.

Examples of broken access control:
- Accidental privileges for actions
- Bypassing access control by modifying the URL (parameter tampering)
- Accessing API:s with missing access control
- Privilege elevation (Access admin with normal user)
etc..

The article also talks about prevention and examples.


<a name="fuzzing-with-ffuf"></a>
#### üîç Fuzzing with ffuf

Fuzzing is similiar to brute forcing but we are not cracking hashes but finding directories, commands, subdomains etc. on websites.

ffuf is considered the fastest fuzzing tool currently.

<a name="access-control-vulnerabilities"></a>
#### üîê Access Control Vulnerabilities (by portswigger)

The article covers weaknesses in web app authentication, session managment and access control.

Some examples:

**Vertical privilege escalation**
user gains access to functions they should not have access to(user to admin).
admin panel accessable with normal user
leaked info in robots.txt

**Parameter based access control**
Gaining access with hidden fields, cookies..

**Horizontal privilege escalation**
Gaining access to another users data, often also used horizontal to vertical escalation.

The article also hosts labs to try out the different vulnerabilities.

<a name="writing-reports"></a>
#### :pencil: Writing reports (Karvinen 2006)

Guide and best practices on how to create homework writeup reports.

Key points:
- Actions have be easily replicated by reader
- Accurate, write what you clicked and what command you used, did it work?
- Easy to read, use headers, avoid typos..
- Mention sources
- NO plagiarism, NO bullshit

## üîì  A) Breaking into 010-staff-only

*Task already completed during class, memorizing and doing it again*

First we need to setup the task, download unzip and run

![SetupChallenge1](h2images/image.png)

Enter 010-staff-only folder and run ```python3 staff-only.py```

now server is online at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

First i tested if injection is possible, with basic 'OR 1=1-- injection

![alt text](h2images/image-3.png)

I see that the app has some kind of protection, seems like its client side

A quick inspect on the form shows that its looking for a number, lets remove this

![](h2images/image-2.png)

The injection now works, but this is not the flag

![](h2images/image-4.png)

Lets find the real password searching table with limit command

```' OR 1=1 LIMIT 2,1-- ```

![alt text](h2images/image-5.png)


 **FLAG{Tero-e45f8764675e4463db969473b6d0fcdd}**

<a name="b-fixing-the-010-staff-only"></a>
## üîß B) Fixing the 010-staff-only

Looking at the code at first feeling lost, then did some research on how to detect vulnerabilities in python code(without using AI), found **bandit** app

![](h2images/image-6.png)

Bandit tells us about possible sql injection that we know works, also tells us about the hardcoded password, but that was not the task to solve.

After reading report tried to edit alot in this section without solution:

```diff
	sql = "SELECT password FROM pins WHERE pin='"+pin+"';"
	row = ""
	with app.app_context():
		res=db.session.execute(text(sql))
		db.session.commit()
		row = res.fetchone()
```


Could not solve without some assistance, went to tips and saw a hint to look into the library

After some google search found some guides and youtube videos but were not able to connect the dots.

https://medium.com/@shrimantshubham/flask-sqlalchemy-tutorial-login-system-with-python-61a3ab9f4990

https://pynative.com/python-mysql-execute-parameterized-query-using-prepared-statement/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMkHXB1aPL4

I wanted to avoid going to chatgpt for help, but then decided to go that route instead of giving up. [chat_pt1](images/image-25.png) [chat_pt2](images/image-26.png)

```diff
-	sql = "SELECT password FROM pins WHERE pin='"+pin+"';"
+	sql = text("SELECT password FROM pins WHERE pin=:pin")
	row = ""
	with app.app_context():
-		res=db.session.execute(text(sql))
+		res=db.session.execute(sql, {"pin": pin})
		db.session.commit()
		row = res.fetchone()
```

Not sure if this is the way but it seems to have fixed the previously working injection. im getting (not found).
![alt text](h2images/image-24.png)

ChatGPT also provided tips to create server side input validation with

```
    if not pin.isdigit():
        return "Invalid input", 400
```
this results to invalid input page when trying to inject sql into form

![](h2images/image-23.png)




final code compared to original:

```

ChatGPT also [suggested](h2images/image-26.png) using ORM query instead of paremeterized query, but since the tips suggested to use parameterized, i went with that solution.


<a name="c-solving-dirfuzt-1"></a>
## üïµÔ∏è C) Solving dirfuzt-1

As a tutorial to fuzz i did the dirfuzt-0 challenge, now onto dirfuzt-1:

First step was to download the target app and running it

![alt text](h2images/image-9.png)

Downloading and running ffuf using dirbuster wordlist

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directories.jbrofuzz -u http://127.0.0.2:8000/FUZZ -mc all -fs 42 -c -v
```

![alt text](h2images/image-10.png)

scanned 58k dirs, now unwanted positive seems to be size 154, lets add  ```-fs 154``` to the command


![alt text](h2images/image-11.png)

Found the flag to admin page
``` FLAG{tero-wpadmin-3364c855a2ac87341fc7bcbda955b580} ``` 

now swapping to common.txt since still need to find version control related page

![](h2images/image-12.png)

Found it
``` FLAG{tero-git-3cc87212bcd411686a3b9e547d47fc51} ``` 


<a name="d-hack-020-your-eyes-only"></a>
## üíª D) Hack 020-your-eyes-only

Setup target

![](h2images/image-13.png)

created a user just to look around

![alt text](h2images/image-14.png)

previous task mentioned fuzzing might be needed, lets try
``` ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directories.jbrofuzz -u http://127.0.0.1:8000/FUZZ -mc all -fs 42 -c -v ```

![alt text](h2images/image-15.png)

seems to be different sizes of 404, quick google resulted to an old article(https://josephthacker.com/hacking/2020/10/27/ffuf-filters.html) mentioning autocalibrate 

adding ```-ac``` to the command, found admin-console

![alt text](h2images/image-16.png)

admin console is just an empty page

![](h2images/image-19.png)

this does not seem to get me anywhere, continue trying different sql injections into the login form..

while inspecting, found hidden csrf input, made it visible

![alt text](h2images/image-17.png)

tried to edit this field also without success of access / injection

![alt text](h2images/image-18.png)

Lots of googling leads me to trying csrf bypass (https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/bypassing-token-validation)

failing at this i then tried lots of different fuzzing commands

```
ffuf -u http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin-console/?FUZZ=true -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt -b "sessionid=7cxnskafc4x892jk2tojmcxkfe4bgl8s" -ac
```
some 5 hours later i give up since i feel lost and on wrong track.

I go back to hack n fix page for some tips, it seems i already found the "flag" was the admin page. **I did not read the task well enough.. and was looking for a flag** üòµ

<a name="e-fixing-020-your-eyes-only"></a>
## üõ†Ô∏è E) Fixing 020-your-eyes-only

I browse around the folders inside /020-your-eyes-only spamming cat on all py files until i find something related to admin-console

found urls.py

i try editing the admin-console to same as admin-dashboard

```diff
from django.urls import path
from django.views.generic import TemplateView
from .views import *

urlpatterns = [
	path('', TemplateView.as_view(template_name="hats/frontpage.html"), name="frontpage"),
	path('my-data/', MyDataView.as_view(), name="my-data"),
	path('admin-dashboard/', AdminDashboardView.as_view(), name="admin-dashboard"),
-	path('admin-console/', AdminShowAllView.as_view(), name="admin-console"),
+       path('admin-console/', AdminDashboardView.as_view(), name="admin-console"),
]
```

![alt text](h2images/image-20.png)

It seems to work, after restarting the server i cant access admin-console anymore:
